# Getting Started with Purrpedia

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Its purpose is to allow users to search for a specific cat breed name, and view relevant information about that breed.

## Installation

### Clone the Repository
`git clone https://github.com/dansmithux/purrpedia.git`\
`cd purrpedia`

### Install Dependencies
`npm install`

### Set Up API Key
You will need an API key from [The Cat API](https://thecatapi.com/) to run this project. 

1. Sign up at [The Cat API](https://thecatapi.com/) to get your free API key.
2. Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add the following line:
`CAT_API_KEY=your_api_key_here`

## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed! I recommend using Vercel or Netlify.

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, please check the following:
- Ensure you have added your API key to the `.env` file.
- Ensure all dependencies are installed by running `npm install` again.
- Check the console for any error messages and follow the suggested solutions.

If the problem persists, please open an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/dansmithux/purrpedia).
